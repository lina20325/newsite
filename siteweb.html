<h2>Artificial Intelligence AI</h2>
<p>It is a set of artificial intelligence and machine learning services. Developers can add pre-built models to applications and processes. Data scientists can build, train and deploy models using preferred open source frameworks or choose to take advantage of the speed of machine learning within the databaseœ.</p>
<h2>The importance of artificial intelligence</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence affects the future of every industrial sector and every human being on the planet. It is also the main driver of all emerging technologies such as collecting big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things. Artificial intelligence is expected to play a larger role in the coming years.

Thanks to artificial intelligence, the field of health care is developing at an increasing speed, and this is accompanied by a significant increase in the amount of data and challenges in terms of cost and patient outcomes. Therefore, artificial intelligence applications have been used to reduce these difficulties, and artificial intelligence is also used to avoid unnecessary routine laboratory tests, and to narrow the circle of analyzes. Laboratory tools that the patient may need, to improve clinical workflow, and to predict hospital-acquired diseases.

Artificial intelligence also increases the efficiency and speed of business implementation, increases its value, contributes to the continuous development of business, and increases the number of those interacting with these businesses due to the continuous development of related tools and software.

And artificial intelligence is important in our daily lives. The use of artificial intelligence applications has caused a major revolution in the automotive industry, as it uses the self-driving program from Google, which uses artificial intelligence techniques to reduce the rate of accidents and reduce traffic congestion, and artificial intelligence applications are used in e-commerce sites to obtain a clear picture of behavior Customers make online purchases and make recommendations, and social networks also use artificial intelligence applications such as Facebook to detect hacked user photos..</p>
